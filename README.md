✔️ **Created data visualizations** using **Matplotlib & Seaborn** to represent insights clearly.  
✔️ **Answered business-driven questions**, such as:  
   - What are the most popular course categories?  
   - How does pricing affect enrollment?  
   - Do higher-rated courses have more students?  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)  
- **NumPy**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  

## 📊 Sample Analysis  
### 🔹 1. Most Popular Course Categories  
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("udemy_data.csv")

# Count course categories
category_counts = df['category'].value_counts().head(10)

# Plot top categories
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
sns.barplot(x=category_counts.index, y=category_counts.values, palette="coolwarm")
plt.title("Top 10 Most Popular Course Categories on Udemy")
plt.xlabel("Category")
plt.ylabel("Number of Courses")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
